# Neon chat

Minimalistic chat app built using server-components on go + htmx.
Default colorscheme is a personal preference, and light/dark mode are... khm... on the horizon.
This app is being build as an excercise for me to 
- learn go practically
- try sqlite db via sqlx, write custom migration module
- explore server sent events for live messaging
- further explore htmx, locality of behaviour, etc
- <s>familiarize with </s>tailwind - surprisingly good, pointless for animations
- <s>prove react is overrated</s>
- <s>finish a project for a change</s>
- maintain project over time, extend functionality, fix bugs

## How to run

### Prerequisites

First run is special. 
We're now going to do a couple of things that we would not have to do on subsequent runs. 
At least not entirely.

I assume you already have golang installed.
You can check if it is by running `go version` in a terminal.
If not, you can refer to [official istallation instruction](https://go.dev/doc/install) for you pc/mac/linux.

There's [tailwind.config.js](./tailwind.config.js) in the root, but it's content is not in use YET. 
Meaning we don't have custom tailwind definition, only relying on built-in utility classes. 
Technically we can simply make a 3rd party call and get entire tailwindcss.min.js from a CDN. 
Still, in the current setup we built tailwind file to produce minimal css. 
[Compiled css](./static/css/tailwind.css) comes out at roughly 15kb, 
about 1/20 of the default minified [cdn provided talwindcss.js](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/3.4.5) wich is around 300kb.

To actually compile this, you'd need to install tailwind. 
There's plenty of options. 
I recommend downloading the [stadalone tailwind cli](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) and avoiding npm completely. 
But if you have nodejs installed and feel more comfortable with it, 
you can [install tailwind via npm](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). 
Note that [run.sh script](./run.sh) specifies path to tailwind executable. 
**That line needs to be updated to match your setup**.

Finally, app expects to have `.env` file in the root directory, which you have to create. 
There's `.env.template` file that you can easily copy-paste and fill up. 
App may still start without this file, as some defaults are provided. 
But the behaviour in this case is unpredicable, thus is a broken state and should fatal exit at some point.

### Preparing run script

Successfull launch of the app requires:
* passing tests
* compiling tailwind
* (optional) purging the db
* launching the app
* etc.

`run.sh` file is just a plaintext shell script. We need to make it executable by running 
`chmod +x run.sh` in project root in terminal. After that, we can start the app by running `sh run.sh` or `./run.sh`.

Contents of [run.sh](./run.sh) is more or less:
```
> cat run.sh
echo "Running tests"
time go test ./...

# for dev purposes
#echo "Dropping db file..."
# rm chat.db
# (la chat.db && echo "...Dropped db successfully.") || echo "...Data not dropped."

echo "Building tailwind..."
~/code/bin/tailwindcss -i static/css/input.css -o static/css/tailwind.css

echo "Starting server..."
go run main.go
```

Notes:
1. by default, db file is created in the root folder where executable runs
2. for db file to be deleted on start, must uncomment appropriate lines
3. tailwind executable call will need to be updated to match your system

### Run script

Executing a script from the terminal, you should then see output similar to:
```
> ./run.sh
Running tests
ok      neon-chat/src/handler     (cached)
ok      neon-chat/src/model/app   (cached)
Starting server...
2024/05/01 00:07:58 Application is starting...
...
2024/05/01 00:07:58 Starting server at port [8080]
```
App should now be available at http://localhost:8080

> <b><u>Note</u></b><br>
After initial successfull run, we will not need to go through any of the setup steps again.

> <b><u>Note</u></b><br>
Executing `./run.sh` also builds the short tailwind.css. 
Making changes to tailwind classes requires rerun to display properly.

## TODOs

+ add license in preparation to publication
+ handler should abstract app and db models completely, only expose templates
+ user name change should update active user info on left panel
+ fucking session transactions

### Next up

+ support ALLOW_UNSAFE_ACCESS for dev and test
+ log levels with [slog in GO 1.23](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Debug)
+ auth middleware
+ introduce ctx
- replace all `<form>` tags with with
```
<div hx-ACTION="/endpoint"
    hx-headers='{"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}'
    hx-vals='{"chatid":{{ .ChatId }},"msgid":{{ .MsgId }}},"userid":{{ .UserId }}}'
```

## Backlog

### Message Broadcasting: 
- msg should distribute to user connection, even if chat is closed
    - relates to 
- pagination, track user deltas in chats and messages
- buffer outgoing events for unstable connection/s

### User Notifications
- new chat invite
- new msg in chat
- @user - display user card on hover
- setting on/off
    - mute / unmute chat
    - blacklist / whitelist users

### Fuzzy search
- search chats by: 
    - by chat name
    - by members
    - by message content
- search messages:
    - by messages content
    - by messages author
    - in chat
- approaches
    - common key [C530, V500] - fast - mostly latin
        - https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#soundex
    - word embeding - %VALUE%
    - edit distance [cindy-cindi=1] - only latin - in-memory
    - statistical similarity - slow

### Testing
- extend unit tests
- add integration tests

### Moderation
- Add ability for users to mute/report other users
- Add ability to ban users from chat

### User Authentication
- throttling api actions - 10x exec time
- middleware auth
- provide authType as form input
- google auth
- *2FA / MFA*
- *crypto wallet*

### Web Calls
- voice chat
- video chat
- effects

### GUI
- change chat title
- collapsible / resizable left panel
- add contacts page / address book
    * limit who can invite add / you
- user info card - avatar, name, contact, mutual chats
- user settings page
    * add alternative auth
    * light/dark mode
- top controls
    * local time now iso
    * local session expiration iso
    * settings link
- bottom controls
    * status ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´
    * light/dark mode switch
- collapsible sub menus
    * active user - logout, setting
    * open chat - close, delete
    * chat members - expel
    * msg options - delete, reply
    

## Never gonna happen, but sounds nice

### Use better templating lib
- switch to Tmpl

### Client storage
- local / innodb
- store chats with history on client
- load only chat deltas

### *Security Considerations*
- Validate nd sanitize all incoming messages to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### *Mini Games*
- embed games into chat, to start
    - XO
    - Battle Ships
    - Chess
    - Go

### *GPTs*:
- Consider for content moderation assistance
- Consider for chat participant - query, image, auto-response
